# HangmanCSharp

Please use https://github.com/KashPiasecki/HangmanJava for reference. 
Today (08.11) I tried to transfer the code from my yesterdays project to C#. I'm really glad that with help of Google and Udemy I managed to get it working as intended. 
I know that I should've used HashMap/Dictionary to load the data, but at the beggining I implemented my data with List of capitals only. Due to current lack of time I decided to leave it as it is,
since it is not a huge problem to solve. I hope that you enjoy my solution.
